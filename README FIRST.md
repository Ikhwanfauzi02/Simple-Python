# Simple-Python
just for practice
Before attempting the Python code in My repository, you must install the Python software on your computer. You can do this by installing it through the Microsoft Store. Additionally, there are several extensions that you must also install via the CMD, as follows:

    pip install pycryptodome
    pip install pillow
    pip3 install pillow
    pip install python-barcode
    pip install tk

You can install them by opening the CMD (Command Prompt), by pressing Win + R, then typing "CMD" in the input field, and pressing enter. After that, enter the installation codes you provided above using the pip install command. Thank you.
